**Understanding concepts of R**

While working in *RStudio*, there are many minor issues faced by researchers which are specific to their own problem. No matter, *stack overflow* caters to most of the needs but
one issue which may still persist many times is the understanding of the concept behind the solution proposed. One may be able to get the required output or get their code 
running but unless the concept behind the function or code is not clear, the applicability of it remains limited for one's future tasks. So this repository will try to put forward some basis functions in R compiled from 
different sources and modified with personal understanding and help gain the conceptual knowledge behind them.  

Further, since doing programming is an ever learning process, so I am always eager to learn more by discussing the issues and have better solutions proposed by anyone out there.

Happy coding..!!
